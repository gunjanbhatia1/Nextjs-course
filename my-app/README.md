# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

//Notes
//name of the component should start with capital letter
//props for passing parameter in components as we do in function
//props is an object where all the attributes are present as key value pair
//that means whatever parameters we pass while using components
//so for props.text not be treated as plain text we can put it into
//{} braces we can only have single line expression here

//useState we register different states and depending on which state is active react will render output
-- these hooks can be only called in components and customised hooks
--pass the parameter for defining initial state
--it will always return two elements one is variable and other setter of variable
first one is present state snapshots when we call it's setter react will reevaluate component and update what is render on the screen
-- for changing what we see on the screen dynamically for adding or removing element for showing text for hiding overlay
--props for reusable component
{modalIsOpen ? <Modal /> : null} shortcut of this {modalIsOpen &&<Modal/>}
